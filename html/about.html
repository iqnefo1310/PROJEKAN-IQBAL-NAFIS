            <h3>CREATE PROJECT A WEBSITE FOR MOVIE WITH TMDB API</h3>
            <p>I have successfully developed a video application designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user
                experience. The creation of this application involved several key stages:

                Initially, I identified the primary goals of the application, focusing on enabling users to easily
                record, edit, and share videos. Additionally, the application supports live streaming, which was
                included based on comprehensive market research. This research allowed me to understand user needs and
                analyze existing video applications to determine the most essential features.

                The design phase was crucial in ensuring a user-friendly interface. I started by creating wireframes to
                organize the layout and navigation of the application. These wireframes served as a visual guide for the
                application's structure. Following this, I developed interactive prototypes to gather early feedback
                from users, ensuring that the design met their expectations and requirements.

                In the backend development, I selected robust technologies to handle video processing, storage, and
                streaming efficiently. The application is built to be scalable, ensuring it can handle a growing number
                of users and high volumes of video content. Security measures were also implemented to protect user data
                and prevent unauthorized access.

                Overall, the development of this video application has been a comprehensive process, integrating user
                feedback and the latest technological advancements to deliver a high-quality, reliable, and user-centric
                platform.</p>
